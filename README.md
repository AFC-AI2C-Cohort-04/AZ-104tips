# AZ-104 Exam Tips

## Getting Started:

### Resources:

I took the AZ-104 exam and wanted to share some tips.

I highly recommend going through the Udemy course, [AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator Exam Prep - OCT 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/70533-azure/). Actively engage in the labs to better your understanding.

Additionally, investing in the [Whizlabs](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-104/) practice exams (currently on sale for $10 as of 20221120) is highly recommended. I found that some questions in the actual exam were the EXACT same to those in these practice exams.

### Hands-on Practice:

If you want, use your CMU email to access $200 in free Azure credits for hands-on practice. Note that the Entra ID portion will have limitations on this account, so consider using the account we are using for class for that section.

## Exam Details:

### Open Book:

While the exam is open book, keep in mind that the access to the Microsoft Learn website is limited. You have a search bar, but you need to know exactly what to type to find the answers. While this can be useful, I wouldn't rely on it entirely due to time constraints. Practice searching for answers efficiently.

### Exam Structure:

The exam structure may vary, but I had one 'lab' with 6 questions and 48 other questions, with a total time of 1 hour and 40 minutes. You may encounter a different structure, including labs or regular questions. I think it varies person to person.

In the lab, you'll have tabs displaying organizational structures, business requirements, current resources (VMs, NICs, VNets, storage accounts, etc), and company goals. Questions will require you to match these requirements, architecture and goals.

### Question Types:

There are various question types, including:

1. Multiple Choice
2. Single Choice
3. Exact Correct Sequence
4. Drag and Match
5. Lab-based scenarios
6. Potentially more (based on my recollection).

FYI: These questions are highly technical!

# My biggest task away:
Dont just know how to configure or create something. Know **when** you can and can't use it, **where** you can and can't use it, what can you use and not use it with, the most cost effective approach and more.

Let me know if you have any other questions. I'll add more if I think of anything else.
